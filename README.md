# OTPView 

## A QT Frontend for E1.59  (Entertainment Technology Object Transform Protocol (OTP)) 

Based upon the ESTA 14 December 2019 _Draft_ - Document Number: CP/2018-1034r2

Extract (emphasis added) from E1.59
"This standard describes a mechanism to transfer object transform information such as position, rotation and velocity over an IP network. It covers data format, data protocol, data addressing, and network management. It does not require real-world location or any association between multiple objects represented in the same message. Consumers must advertise which modules they support, and the systems they are transmitting using the Advertisement mechanisms.

<b>Data transmitted is intended to coordinate visual and audio elements of a production and should not be used for safety critical applications.</b>"

Based upon Document Number: CP/2018-1034r5 (Dated 19 January 2021)

Extract (emphasis added) from E1.59
"This standard describes a mechanism to transfer object transform information such as position, rotation and velocity over an IP network. It covers data format, data protocol, data addressing, and network management. It does not require real-world location or any association between multiple objects represented in the same message.

<b>Data transmitted is intended to coordinate visual and audio elements of a production and should not be
used for safety critical applications.</b>"

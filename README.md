## A QT Frontend for E1.59  (Entertainment  Technology  Object  Transform  Protocol  (OTP)) 

Based upon the ESTA 10 January 2019 _Draft_ - Document Number: CP/2018-1034r1

Extract (emphasis added) from  E1.59
"This standard describes a mechanism to transfer object transform information such as position, orientation and velocity over an IP network using a subset of the [ACN] protocol suite. It covers data format, data protocol, data addressing, and network management. It does not require real-world location or any association between multiple objects represented in the same message. Consumers must advertise which modules they support, and the systems they are transmitting using the Advertisement mechanisms.

<b>Data transmitted is intended to coordinate visual and audio elements of a production and should not be used for safety critical applications.</b>"
